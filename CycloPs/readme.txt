Installation instructions.

Cyclops comes as a self-contained packaged application. 
It does not require any installation apart from dragging and dropping.
It has been tested on Mac OS X Snow Leopard, Windows 7 and Windows XP, 
and Ubuntu Linux


CUSTOM PEPTIDE STRUCTURES
To add custom peptide structures, available to peptide generation functions, add the peptides
to the zinc_output file in the format <SMILES\tNAME> where \t is the TAB character, SMILES is the
peptide SMILES string with the N-terminus at the start, and the C-terminus at the end, in
the form C(=O)O. These peptides will then be available to add to the library in the 'ZINC amino acids' 
option in the 'Modify Amino-acid library' menu.


GENERATING PEPTIDE LIBRARIES FROM TEXT FILES
CycloPs can generate peptide libraries from text files of peptide sequences and desired constraints.
See the included 'example_peptide_file.txt' file for the an example and description of syntax.
