#This is an example peptide library file to demonstrate CycloPs peptide library
#generation from a file ability.
#Each line must contain a single peptide and bond definition, seperated by
#a semicolon. Lines starting in #, and empty lines, are ignored.
#Peptide sequences can be written as single letter strings (like 'ASG') or
#as full amino-acid names, seperated by commas ('L-Alanine,L-Serine,Glycine')
#CycloPs understands all 20 amino acid letters, uper case for L-aminos, lower 
#case for D-aminos 
#The full list of built-in long names is given below.

#BOND DEFINITION SYNTAX
#The constraint spec is a string with the first 2 characters 
#identifiying the constraint type, (HT, SS, SC), 
#then one character per residue in the sequence, which is 'X' for 
#residues not involved in constraints, 'C' for
#disulphide bonding residues, 'N' for n-terminal like sidechains, 'Z' for
#c-terminal like sidechains, and 'E' for ester bonding sidechains.
#Leave the bond definition blank for linear peptides.
