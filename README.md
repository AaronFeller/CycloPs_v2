# CycloPs_v2: A Cyclic Peptide Library Generator

**CycloPs_v2** is a cyclic peptide library generator designed to facilitate the creation and exploration of diverse peptide libraries, including noncanonical and cyclic peptides. This package was released in its current state based on interest generated by the **PeptideCLM model**, as described in a [bioRxiv paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.08.09.607221v1).

> **Please cite the PeptideCLM paper** (or its published version) if you use this package. A JOSS paper on CycloPs_v2 is forthcoming.

## Usage Guide

1. **Generate Peptides**:
   - Run `generate_randpeps.py` to generate random peptide sequences.
   
2. **Generate SMILES Notation**:
   - Pass the resulting FASTA file to `PepLibGen/StructGen/fasta.py` for SMILES generation. 
   - The output is a text file, with each line containing:
     ```
     {Comma-separated Amino Acids}-{cyclization notation}: {SMILES string}
     ```

3. **Noncanonical Modifications**:
   - The Jupyter notebook `build_noncanon_aa.ipynb` provides workflows for adding modifications like N-methylation and PEGylation.
   - These modifications will be packaged as functions in future releases.

4. **Amino Acid Notation**:
   - Notation for single-character amino acids is found in `PepLibGen/StructGen/aminoacids.py`.

## Future Work
Improvements, including modular functions for peptide modifications and additional SMILES generation options, are in progress.
